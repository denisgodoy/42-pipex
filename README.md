- [Evaluation](https://github.com/denisgodoy/42-pipexf#evaluation)

## Mandatory part

| Program 	|  Description  |    Libraries   	|    External functions   	|
|:--------:	|:------------:	|:------------:	|:------------:	|
|  pipex 	|Produces output to outfile after the execution of two shell commands, simulating `pipe` and `redirection`.|   stdio.h, fcntl.h, stdlib.h, unistd.h, sys/types.h, sys/wait.h, string.h  	|  access, open, write, unlink, close, malloc, waitpid, free, pipe, dup2, execve, fork, perror, strerror, exit|

The pipex program simulates real shell commands as follows:
```shell
< infile.txt grep 42 | wc -w > outfile.txt
```

Clone and compile:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/denisgodoy/42-pipex.git pipex
cd pipex
make all
```

Create an infile with the content you want, choose the commands and execute like this:
```shell
./pipex infile.txt "grep 42" "wc -w" outfile.txt
```
